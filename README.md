# 2D Car Racing Game

## Description
This project was developed in Qt during the bachelor days, as part of the course "Grundkurs C++". The game allows the user to drive a car on a very simple map.<br>
Thereby the main goal is to collect as many coins as possible, in the shortest amount of time (and of course to break the records - duh).<br>
